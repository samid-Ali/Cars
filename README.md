Project pulling data from car adverts on AutoTrader

This project scrapes adverts from AutoTrader to obtain a dataset with key information including price, mileage, and year of registration. 

Note, AutoTrader only allows searching up to 100 pages, so you may need to adjust your query when running the script to reflect this.

I am currently working on adding brand and model data to this project. To aid with this, I have obtained a list of car brands from Autotrader from the following link (saved inAutoTraderCarBrands).

I am also working to standardise the Key detail fields.
